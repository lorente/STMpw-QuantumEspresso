# STMpw-QuantumEspresso
This is the Quantum Espresso compatible fork of the [STMpw](https://github.com/qphensurf/STMpw/) code for STM images, differential conductance maps and more in the Tersoff-Hamann approximation.

It was tested with QE 7.0 but should be backwards compatible to QE 6.7 forward. 

To compile it, clone the repository to a location that makes sense (for example inside your QE root directory), adjust the TOPDIR in the provided Makefile and issue a make command. 

For details on what the code does check the original [STMpw](https://github.com/qphensurf/STMpw/) version. An example is provided to help you get started.
